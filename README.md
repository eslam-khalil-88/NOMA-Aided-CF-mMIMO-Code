# NOMA-Aided-CF-mMIMO-Code
Design code for NOMA Cell-Free Massive MIMO

##### 1.CellFreeSystem: used for creating system parameters including number of Access Points (APs), number of users (UEs), and their locations with path-loss of each.

##### 2.PrecodingConjugate: gives the precoded signal using conjugate beamforming, to be used in the downlink signal.

##### 3.NOMASignal_Downlink: Create the precoded/weighted downlink signal for the system, and superposing all signals of the 2 users with power multiplexing.

##### 4.Testing_NOMACF: Testing and graphing achievable rate of the system, compared to number of users.

This is a 4-code file project for a single antenna users and single antenna AP of a NOMA Aided Cell Free Massive
MIMO system.
